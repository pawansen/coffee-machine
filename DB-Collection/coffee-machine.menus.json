  "name": "Espresso",
  "description": "Espresso is made by forcing nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans, which results in a concentrated, syrup-like coffee drink. This is the base for many Italian beverages in coffee shops. When compared to regular brewed coffee, espresso is much stronger than the other types of coffee drinks. Espressos are enjoyed in shots where a single shot is one ounce and a long (single and double) shot is two ounces in amount, respectively.",

  "name": "Iced Latte",
  "description": "A latte is an espresso with steamed milk and a dollop of milk foam on top. This beverage is more prevalent in America than other coffee drinks like cappuccinos because it contains less foam, making it smoother and gentler for those with sensitive palettes. And if you want to spice up your latte, add some flavouring syrup. To make an iced version of this drink, simply pour espresso and steamed milk over ice cubes.",

Their ratio depends on what you prefer; whether you want more coffee or chocolate, your mocha will shine in any coffee shop.",

The name came about during World War II when European baristas added water to their espresso drinks for the American soldiers stationed there. The resulting drink had a smoother, less concentrated flavour than espresso and thus the Americano was born.",
